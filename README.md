# Minimalist Task Management API with Authentication  
Built with **FastAPI**, **SQLAlchemy**, and **JWT Authentication**

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a clean and minimal backend API that provides:

- User **sign-up and login** with JWT authentication  
- Full **CRUD operations** for tasks  
- Integration with **SQLite** (local) or **PostgreSQL** (via Docker)
- Auto-generated **Swagger documentation** at `/docs`
- Environment-based configuration for easy deployment

It is ideal for learning backend fundamentals or presenting to clients as a demonstration of practical API development skills.
